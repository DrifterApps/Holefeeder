## Introduction

The main purpose of this repository is to make myself known and this is also a constant work in progress to learn new designs, architecture, technologies where the main goal is to be the most efficient in my craft and offering the best/simple solutions for the job.

Here are some of the key concepts and articles which drives my thinking today:

1. [Domain Driven Desgin](https://martinfowler.com/tags/domain%20driven%20design.html)
2. [Event Sourcing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing)
